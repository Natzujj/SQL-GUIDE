# SQL COMMAND TYPES

## Description

Welcome to the SQL COMMAND TYPES section! This space is dedicated to exploring various SQL command categories, each serving distinct purposes in database management. Delve into the intricacies of Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Control Language (DCL), Transaction Control Language (TCL), and Data Query Language (DQL). Learn about essential commands such as `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, and more, and empower yourself with the knowledge to interact with databases effectively. Let's navigate the diverse world of SQL commands together!

## 1 - Data Definition Language (DDL)

### `CREATE`:
The `CREATE` statement is used to create a new database, table, view, or other database objects.

### `DROP`:

The `ALTER` statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding or deleting columns in a table.

### `TRUNCATE`:
The `TRUNCATE` statement is used to remove all records from a table but retains the structure for future use.

### `COMMENT`:
The `COMMENT` statement is used to add comments to the data dictionary, providing additional information about a database object.

### `RENAME`:
The `RENAME` statement is used to rename a table or other database object.

## 2 - Data Manipulation Language (DML)

### `INSERT`:
The `INSERT` statement is used to add new records (rows) to a table.

### `UPDATE`:
The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing records in a table.

### `DELETE`:
The `DELETE` statement is used to remove records from a table.

### `LOCK`:
The `LOCK` statement is used to control access to a database, allowing or preventing multiple users from accessing the same data simultaneously.

### `MERGE`:

## 3 - Data Control Language (DCL)

### `GRANT`:
The `GRANT` statement is used to provide specific privileges to a user or a group of users.

### `REVOKE`:
The `REVOKE` statement is used to remove specific privileges previously granted to a user or a group of users.

## 4 - Transaction Control Language (TCL)

### `COMMIT`:
The `COMMIT` statement is used to permanently save changes made during the current transaction.

### `ROLLBACK`:
The `ROLLBACK` statement is used to undo changes made during the current transaction.

### `SAVEPOINT`:
The `SAVEPOINT` statement is used to set a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.

### `SET TRANSACTION`:
The `SET TRANSACTION` statement is used to set properties for a transaction.

## 5 - Data Query Language (DQL)

### `SELECT`:
