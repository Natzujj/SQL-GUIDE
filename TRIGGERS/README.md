# Triggers

Triggers are a powerful feature in databases that enable the automatic execution of actions in response to specific events, providing greater control and automation in operations. Here are some situations where triggers can be useful:

## 1. Auditing and Tracking

Use triggers to track important changes in your tables. By creating an `AFTER UPDATE` or `AFTER INSERT` trigger, you can automatically record who made the modification, when, and which fields were altered. This facilitates auditing and issue resolution.

### Key Commands:
- **`CREATE TRIGGER`**: Creates a new trigger to define the logic to be executed in response to specific events.

## 2. Referential Integrity

Triggers can be employed to maintain referential integrity between tables. For example, when deleting a record in a parent table, a trigger can ensure that corresponding records in the child table are removed to avoid orphaned references.

### Key Commands:
- **`INSTEAD OF DELETE`**: Replaces the default deletion operation, allowing customization of the removal logic.

## 3. Data Validation

Use triggers to enforce custom validation rules. If specific requirements exist for the data to be inserted or updated in a table, `INSTEAD OF INSERT` and `INSTEAD OF UPDATE` triggers can be used to validate and even modify the data as needed.

### Key Commands:
- **`INSTEAD OF INSERT`**: Replaces the default insertion operation, allowing data validation and customization.

## 4. Automatic Updates

Automate recurring updates with `AFTER INSERT` or `AFTER UPDATE` triggers. For instance, upon inserting or modifying records, a trigger can automatically update related fields in other tables, saving time and ensuring data consistency.

### Key Commands:
- **`AFTER INSERT`**: Executes the defined logic after the insertion of new records.
- **`AFTER UPDATE`**: Executes the defined logic after the update of existing records.

## 5. Access Control

Implement triggers to control access to specific operations. By defining `INSTEAD OF DELETE` or `INSTEAD OF UPDATE` triggers, you can customize permissions and restrict access to specific actions based on custom logic.

### Key Commands:
- **`INSTEAD OF DELETE`**: Replaces the default deletion operation, allowing customization of permissions and deletion logic.
- **`INSTEAD OF UPDATE`**: Replaces the default update operation, allowing customization of permissions and update logic.
